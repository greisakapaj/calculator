Welcome to this simple Calculator! This calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations as well as some logical comparisons. Follow the instructions below to use the calculator:

1. Enter Numbers:

   - When prompted, enter the first number and the second number. These can be any real numbers, including decimals.

2. Select Operation:

   - After entering the numbers, you will be prompted to choose an operation. Enter one of the following symbols or keywords for the desired operation:
      - `+` : Addition
      - `-` : Subtraction
      - `*` : Multiplication
      - `/` : Division
      - `%` : Modulus
      - `compare` : Compare numbers
      - `or` : Logical OR
      - `and` : Logical AND
      - `xor` : Logical XOR

3. View Result:

   - The calculator will then display the result based on the chosen operation.

4. Error Handling:

   - If you attempt to divide by zero (0) using the division or modulus operation, the calculator will display an error message: "Error: Division by zero" or "Error: Modulus by zero."

5. Logical Operations:

   - For logical operations (`or`, `and`, `xor`), the calculator will convert the input numbers into boolean values. For non-zero numbers, the boolean value is considered `True`, and for zero, it is considered `False`.

6. Invalid Operation:

   - If you enter an invalid operation or a mistyped keyword, the calculator will display the message: "Invalid operation."

Example Usage:
 
   Enter the first number: 20
   Enter the second number: 2
   Enter the operation (+, -, *, /, %, compare, or, and, xor): *

   Result: 40

Feel free to experiment with different numbers and operations. If you have any questions, refer to this manual or seek assistance. Happy calculating!
